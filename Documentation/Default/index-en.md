### INTRO

>   Recently, I have been looking for a suitable c # UI solution, most of which do not meet the standards in my heart. A little more beautiful and expensive. And there are all kinds of forced advertising, like me, it is unaffordable. . . As far as WPF is concerned, it's actually very good, but it's just a little bit disappointing. I don't know what GraphUI will do, at least I'm doing what I like.
>
>   This project is just to make your UI more beautiful. You can download the source code and package it into your program, which may make the project more streamlined. My qualifications are not deep, and even a few advanced grammars are not commonly used.
>
>   Co-development or even uploading errors is the best support for me.
>
>   Thanks to sharpdevelop of ic # code, this is the best development tool I have ever used
>
>   In addition, <font color = red>is prohibited for commercial use and do not do bad things</font>
